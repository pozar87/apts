## 2025-01-30 - [Astronomical Computation Bottleneck]
**Learning:** Iterative astronomical solvers (like Skyfield's find_discrete) are exceptionally slow when applied to Keplerian orbits evaluated in Python (e.g., minor planets). Vectorizing these calculations using a geometric approximation provides a massive speedup (5x in this case) with acceptable accuracy trade-offs for visualization. Additionally, redundant instantiation of complex objects (like Place, which involves timezone lookups) adds unnecessary overhead that can be bypassed using lightweight surrogates.
**Action:** Always prefer vectorized geometric approximations for non-critical astronomical visualizations. Use SimpleNamespace or similar to mock heavy objects in performance-critical loops when only a few properties are needed.
