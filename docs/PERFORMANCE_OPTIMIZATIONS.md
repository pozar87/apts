# APTS Performance Optimizations

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive performance optimizations implemented in the APTS (Astronomical Planning and Tracking System) to significantly improve test execution speed and overall application performance.

## Performance Improvements Summary

### Test Suite Performance
- **Before Optimization**: 282.51 seconds (4 minutes 42 seconds)
- **After Optimization**: 62.59 seconds (1 minute 2 seconds)
- **Performance Gain**: ~77% faster (4.5x speedup)

### Individual Test Improvements
| Test Category | Before (seconds) | After (seconds) | Improvement |
|---------------|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| Solar Objects | 15.38 | 1.48 | 90% faster |
| Messier Objects | 14+ | <2 | 85%+ faster |
| Observation Tests | 14+ | <2 | 85%+ faster |
| Planet Calculations | 13+ | <2 | 84%+ faster |

## Key Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Configuration-Based Minor Planet Filtering

**Problem**: The application was loading the entire MPCORB database (84MB, hundreds of thousands of objects) for every test that used dwarf planet calculations.

**Solution**: 
- Created test-specific configuration (`tests/apts_test.ini`) that limits dwarf planet loading to only essential objects
- Reduced from ~400,000 objects to 5 essential dwarf planets (Ceres, Pallas, Haumea, Makemake, Eris)

**Implementation**:
```ini
[minor_planets]
# Load only essential dwarf planets for testing
load_only = 00001, 00002, K08S73P, K05X53E, K03E75A
```

**Impact**: Reduced MPCORB data loading time from 12+ seconds to milliseconds in subsequent operations.

### 2. Session-Scoped Cache Preloading

**Problem**: Tests were clearing LRU caches before every test, causing expensive data to be reloaded repeatedly.

**Solution**:
- Implemented session-scoped fixtures that preload expensive data once per test session
- Modified `conftest.py` to load ephemeris, MPCORB, timescale, and Hipparcos data once
- Tests now reuse cached data instead of reloading

**Implementation**:
```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def preload_expensive_data():
    """Pre-load expensive data once per test session."""
    get_timescale()
    get_ephemeris()
    get_mpcorb_data()  # Uses limited set from test config
    get_hipparcos_data()
    return True
```

**Impact**: Eliminated redundant data loading across 164 tests, saving ~200+ seconds of cumulative loading time.

### 3. Selective Cache Clearing

**Problem**: Automatic cache clearing before every test was unnecessary and counterproductive.

**Solution**:
- Removed automatic cache clearing from `conftest.py`
- Implemented pytest markers for selective cache clearing
- Only specific tests that require fresh cache state clear caches

**Implementation**:
```python
# Tests can now use markers to request cache clearing when needed
@pytest.mark.clear_mpcorb  # Clear only MPCORB cache
@pytest.mark.clear_caches  # Clear all caches
def test_function():
    pass
```

**Impact**: 90%+ of tests now benefit from cached data, dramatically reducing execution time.

### 4. Code-Level Caching Optimizations

**Problem**: Expensive astronomical object retrievals were being repeated unnecessarily.

**Solution**: Added strategic `@functools.lru_cache` decorators to frequently called methods.

**Solar Objects Optimization**:
```python
@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=32)
def _get_skyfield_object_cached(self, obj_name):
    """Internal cached version of skyfield object retrieval."""
    return planetary.get_skyfield_obj(obj_name)
```

**Messier Objects Optimization**:
```python
@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def get_skyfield_object_cached(self, obj_id):
    """Cached version of skyfield object retrieval using object ID."""
    obj_row = self.objects.loc[obj_id]
    return obj_row.skyfield_object
```

**Impact**: Reduced repeated skyfield object instantiation, saving seconds per test.

### 5. Lazy Loading Implementation

**Problem**: Minor planet data was being loaded immediately during object initialization, even when not needed.

**Solution**: Implemented lazy loading pattern for MPCORB data.

**Implementation**:
```python
class SolarObjects(Objects):
    def __init__(self, place, calculation_date=None):
        super(SolarObjects, self).__init__(place)
        self._minor_planets = None  # Lazy loading
        
    @property
    def minor_planets(self):
        """Lazy loading of minor planets data."""
        if self._minor_planets is None:
            self._minor_planets = get_mpcorb_data()
        return self._minor_planets
```

**Impact**: Defers expensive data loading until actually needed, improving initialization speed.

### 6. Streamlined Configuration Loading

**Problem**: Complex configuration import chains were causing initialization overhead.

**Solution**:
- Refactored `config.py` to support dynamic configuration paths
- Implemented `load_config()` and path management functions
- Simplified test configuration setup

**Implementation**:
```python
def load_config():
    """Load configuration from the defined config paths."""
    config.clear()
    found_configs = config.read(config_paths)
    # ... initialization logic

def add_config_path(path, priority=False):
    """Add a new configuration file path."""
    if priority:
        config_paths.insert(0, path)
    else:
        config_paths.append(path)
```

**Impact**: More efficient configuration loading and easier test setup.

## Performance Analysis Results

### Cache Performance Analysis

Using the built-in performance analyzer:

```
Cold Cache Performance:
- MPCORB loading: 12.231s (first load)
- Ephemeris loading: 0.001s 
- Timescale loading: 0.000s

Warm Cache Performance:
- MPCORB loading: 0.000s (cached)
- Ephemeris loading: 0.000s (cached)
- Timescale loading: 0.000s (cached)
```

This demonstrates the effectiveness of our caching strategy - a 12+ second operation becomes instantaneous when cached.

## Best Practices for Maintaining Performance

### 1. Cache Management
- Use session-scoped caching for expensive, read-only data
- Only clear caches when absolutely necessary for test isolation
- Monitor cache hit rates and effectiveness

### 2. Configuration Management
- Use test-specific configurations to limit data loading during testing
- Prefer configuration-based filtering over code-based filtering for large datasets

### 3. Lazy Loading Patterns
- Defer expensive operations until actually needed
- Use property decorators for transparent lazy loading
- Cache results of expensive computations

### 4. Testing Strategies
- Use pytest markers for selective cache clearing
- Profile slow tests to identify optimization opportunities
- Monitor test execution time trends

## Conclusion

These optimizations resulted in a 4.5x speedup in test execution time while maintaining full functionality and test coverage. The improvements focus on:

1. **Intelligent caching** - Loading expensive data once and reusing it
2. **Selective operations** - Only doing work when necessary
3. **Configuration-driven optimization** - Using settings to limit resource usage
4. **Strategic code improvements** - Adding caching at the right architectural points

The performance improvements make the development cycle significantly faster and more productive, while the monitoring tools ensure that performance remains optimal as the codebase evolves.
